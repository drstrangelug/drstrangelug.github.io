      Straker walked into the control room, followed by Colonels Foster and
      Lake.
    </p>

    <p>
      He crossed to the main communications console, which today was manned by
      Lieutenant Harper.
    </p>

    <p>“How many children?” he asked.</p>

    <p>
      “Forty-four, sir,” she replied. “But Boscombe has launched a helicopter
      and they’re seeing more making their way in.”
    </p>

    <p>“On their own?”</p>

    <p>“Yes, sir. By bicycle, some — but most on foot.”</p>

    <p>“Any hostile action?”</p>

    <p>
      “Not towards the base. What the guards describe as boisterous near-fights
      amongst some of them. A bit of football. Mostly they’re just playing.”
    </p>

    <p>“This isn’t good,” Foster said, concern evident on his face.</p>

    <p>
      “Tell me something I don’t know,” Straker replied. “All right — Foster,
      get down there and take charge of the situation.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Foster turned to leave, but Straker spoke again — to Foster, and to the
      room at large.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Let me make one thing clear. The welfare of the children is secondary to
      the integrity of SHADO operations.”
    </p>

    <p>Foster nodded and left. Straker turned to Lake.</p>

    <p>
      “Get over to Oxford and bring Sterling back,” Straker said. “I want to
      know what he knows — and whether he can help stop this.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Sir?” Lieutenant Harper interjected. “If you’re bringing in Sterling, I’d
      recommend you also bring Miss Collins. She heads their engineering
      department. She knows the machines inside and out.”
    </p>

    <p>Straker considered that for half a second.</p>

    <p>
      “Then go with Lake and get her. Get anyone you think can help — Collins,
      the accountant, even the tea lady,” he said, turning back to Lake. “Take
      security, and don’t take no for an answer.”
