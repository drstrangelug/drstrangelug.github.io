      “Aliens? UFOs?!” Sterling stood aghast, then glanced around at Straker’s
      office.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sarah Collins stood quietly beside him, one hand resting on the model of
      the Moon. She turned it a few degrees, then stopped, as if realising she’d
      done it without thinking.
    </p>

    <p>Sterling sat down on the black plastic sofa near the wall.</p>

    <p>
      “I wouldn’t believe it,” he said at last, “but governments don’t spend
      billions building secret hideouts underneath film studios for nothing.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yes,” Straker said evenly. “They’re real. And the threat is real, Mr
      Sterling.”
    </p>

    <p>“And through my computer they’re brainwashing children?”</p>

    <p>“Yes. And we need to stop it.”</p>

    <p>Sterling ran a hand through his hair.</p>

    <p>
      “How did they get inside our design? Our computers are internally
      designed. Off-the-shelf components, assembled by us.”
    </p>

    <p>Collins coughed lightly.</p>

    <p>“Not quite, sir,” she said. “Do you remember the baud-rate problem?”</p>

    <p>“Baud-rate problem?” Lake asked.</p>

    <p>
      “Yes. Early prototypes couldn’t load programs at any usable speed — half
      an hour for a single load. We assumed interference, or a design flaw.”
    </p>

    <p>“And how did you solve it?” Straker asked.</p>

    <p>“Mr Sterling asked for help,” Collins said, nodding toward him.</p>

    <p>Sterling bristled.</p>

    <p>
      “I didn’t ask for help,” he said, standing and straightening his jacket.
      “I mentioned the issue to the investor group. They offered assistance —
      from one of their other companies. Part of the Northgate family.”
    </p>

    <p>He hesitated, then continued.</p>

    <p>“Pennine Precision Electronics.”</p>

    <p>Collins nodded.</p>

    <p>
      “They had it solved over a weekend. Very capable engineers. We were
      planning to use them again for the next-generation model's memory
      switching.”
    </p>

    <p>She glanced at Lake.</p>

    <p>“Or… we were going to.”</p>

    <p>Straker cut at that point</p>

    <p>“I’m less interested in how they did it than how we shut it down.”</p>

    <p>
      “Can’t you block the signal, locate where it’s coming from, and shut it
      down?” Collins asked.
    </p>

    <p>Lake shook her head.</p>

    <p>
      “No. We can’t detect it directly — only its effects on the circuitry.”
    </p>

    <p>“Then how do you know it’s an external signal?”</p>

    <p>“We accidentally blocked it with lead, and it stopped.”</p>

    <p>Collins thought for a second.</p>

    <p>“I have an idea.”</p>
