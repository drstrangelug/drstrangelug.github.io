    <h2>Idea</h2>
    <p>
      This chapter, obviously, is UFO intersecting with the early home computer
      boom of the 1990s. This is <i>my</i> chapter more than any other.

    <h2>Execution</h2>
    <p>
      This one <i>hurt</i> more than I expected when I finished it. Killing
      Freddie Calderton was difficult, and I felt terrible doing it. But somehow
      I couldn't shy away. It was very UFO and needed to happen. Sorry Freddie.

    <h2>Casting</h2>

      So the main casting for this would be who would play{" "}
