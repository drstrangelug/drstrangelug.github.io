      “On a lunar module?” Straker’s voice strained with incredulity. “A child
      on a lunar module?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” Foster replied. “The children attempted a mass breach. It was
      a distraction.” . And we have security footage — it’s definitely a child.
      He’s onboard now.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “I’ll get the module turned around,” Straker said, already moving. “You’re
      going to Yorkshire tonight.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yorkshire?” Foster said and looked at his watch. “Who am I waking up?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Pennine Precision Electronics. They’re involved in the signal somehow.
      We’ll pull names and addresses - you wake them up.”
    </p>

    <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

    <p>
      Straker replaced the phone hard and stepped out into the control room.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Get me comms to Lunar Flight Three Alpha,” he said. “Turn them around.
      Tell them they have a stowaway.”
    </p>

    <p>Lieutenant Harper, back on communications duty, was already moving.</p>

    <p>“SHADO Control to Lunar Flight Three Alpha.”</p>

    <p>She waited.</p>

    <p>“SHADO Control to Lunar Flight Three Alpha. Come in, please.”</p>

    <p>Silence.</p>

    <p>
      “Sir,” Harper said, fingers flying now, “no response from Flight Three
      Alpha. Running diagnostics.”
    </p>

    <p>Straker didn’t look at her but at the tracking chart.</p>

    <p>
      “Diagnostics negative,” Harper reported. “No comms fault detected.
      Telemetry still solid — five by five.”
    </p>

    <p>“Any anomalies?”</p>

    <p>She scanned the data readouts, her expression tightening.</p>

    <p>
      “Power loss on primary and backup radio comms.” she said. “And a slight
      increase in carbon dioxide levels in the scrubber intakes.”
    </p>

    <p>Straker answered immediately.</p>

    <p>“That increase will be a small boy.”</p>

    <p>Harper froze.</p>

    <p>Her hand rose to her mouth before she could stop it.</p>

    <p>“Oh my God.”</p>
