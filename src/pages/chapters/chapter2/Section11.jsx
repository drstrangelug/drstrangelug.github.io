      Straker walked into the technical workshop. Lake and Foster were already
      there, talking to Dr. Kelly. Four Sterling Prism computers lay across
      various benches. Two were in different states of disassembly; one was
      mid-load, its tape signal displayed on an oscilloscope nearby.
    </p>

    <p>He peered at the computers.</p>

    <p>“What are these? Is this what you called me about?”</p>

    <p>“They’re computers,” Lake replied. “Sterling Prism models.”</p>

    <p>
      Straker picked one up, turned it over in his hands, and tapped the casing
      once with a knuckle — then blinked in surprise at how insubstantial it
      felt.
    </p>

    <p>
      “This little thing is a computer?” His mind immediately snapped to the
      cabinet-sized units that filled most of SHADO control. “What is it about
      and how is this little toy involved?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “We’ve had two incidents recently,” Lake said, “both involving children
      finding their way into, or too close to, our facilities. None of them knew
      why. All three had one of these.”
    </p>

    <p>“And that’s the only connection?” Straker asked.</p>

    <p>Dr. Kelly stepped around his bench.</p>

    <p>
      “It’s not really a toy, sir. It’s actually a very clever bit of kit — a
      basic computer for home use, capable enough to teach fundamental
      principles. But the interesting part is this.”
    </p>

    <p>
      He pointed with a screwdriver at a small grille, then at the circuitry
      surrounding it, tracing a wire deeper into the case.
    </p>

    <p>
      “This speaker sits next to a very sophisticated — and very small —
      receiver. And the case's RF shield - it looks as though it's being used as
      an earth as well. But in practice it’s acting as an antenna.
    </p>

    <p>Kelly straightened himself.</p>

    <p>
      “That’s probably why it has that odd pattern. It’s not design, and it’s
      not about saving metal — it’s a precise antenna shape. And we can’t tell
      what it’s picking up. The frequency is well above anything we can detect.”
    </p>

    <p>"The how do you know there's a signal?" asked Straker.</p>

    <p>
      “We only discovered it by accident. During a lockdown drill, the steel and
      lead door closed and created enough of a Faraday cage to block the
      signal.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Straker peered down at the circuitry, studying the minute components. He
      remembered the transistor and valve computers of his Air Force days and
      marvelled at how small this was.
    </p>

    <p>
      “So you know it’s receiving,” he said. “Do you know what it’s receiving?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “A very complex sequence of shifting tones,” Kelly replied. “It repeats
      over three minutes and nineteen seconds, with a five-point-seven-second
      pause.”
    </p>

    <p>“That tells me everything — and nothing,” Straker said.</p>

    <p>Foster spoke next.</p>

    <p>
      “We thought the signal was hypnotising the children. Or making them
      suggestible. Or something like that. But it’s not just the signal.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Lake held up one of the program tapes — a game called Krazey Kitchens. The
      case was colourful and cartoonish.
    </p>

    <p>
      “This is one of the program tapes,” she said. “A digital signal on a
      consumer-grade cassette. We think it’s the combination of the tape noise
      and the signal together that affects the children.”
    </p>

    <p>“Affects how?” Straker asked.</p>

    <p>“We don’t know,” Lake and Foster said together.</p>
