      Hale turned and fought with the hatch to the cargo bay. It wasn’t designed
      to be opened quickly.
    </p>

    <p>“It has to be the control line,” he said.</p>

    <p>Nakamura struggled with his suit seals in the cramped cockpit.</p>

    <p>“You’ll never fit through the hatch,” Hale said.</p>

    <p>
      “I’m going to damn well try,” Nakamura snapped. “I came back to fly an
      interceptor — not get shot down by one.”
    </p>

    <p>Hale hauled the hatch back and froze.</p>

    <p>“What the hell — who are you?!”</p>

    <p>“What?” Nakamura asked, his suit half off.</p>

    <p>“There’s a kid back here!”</p>

    <p>“This is no time for jokes!”</p>

    <p>“Don’t take me home!” Freddie screamed.</p>

    <p>
      Hale looked past him and saw the panel behind the boy. The screws hung
      loose.
    </p>

    <p>
      “What did you do?!” Hale shouted — but he didn’t wait for an answer. He
      reached in, trying to pull the boy clear.
    </p>

    <p>“No!” Freddie screamed, kicking back wildly.</p>

    <p>“Kid, we’re going to die if I don’t get in there!”</p>

    <p>“I’m not going home! I’m going to the Moon!”</p>

    <p>The Moon.</p>

    <p>The Moon.</p>

    <p>Get to the Moon.</p>

    <p>The thought filled Freddie’s head, crowding everything else out.</p>

    <p>He was so close. He could see it through the cockpit window.</p>

    <p>
      A flash of white light burst through the bay and he shielded his eyes.
    </p>

    <p>“Oh my God — they’re doing it!” Nakamura shouted.</p>

    <p>The cockpit lights flickered. Went out. Then came back.</p>

    <p>The slight buzz in Freddie’s head vanished.</p>

    <p>Silence.</p>

    <p>He began to cry and started to curl up.</p>

    <p>
      “Kid!” Hale shouted. “Open that panel and reconnect the cable or we’re all
      dead!”
    </p>

    <p>The urgency cut through the fog. Freddie turned.</p>

    <p>His hands shook as he loosened the screws and pulled them free.</p>

    <p>“That’s it,” Hale called. “Keep going.”</p>

    <p>“Preparing for emergency burn!” Nakamura shouted.</p>

    <p>
      Freddie tore the panel away and reached inside, fingers scrabbling until
      he found the plug. He pushed it in and began to turn.
    </p>

    <p>“The other way!” Hale yelled.</p>

    <p>Freddie twisted it back. The plug seated itself.</p>

    <p>A circuit lit.</p>

    <p>“Engine on!” Hale shouted.</p>

    <p>Weight slammed back into the world.</p>

    <p>Freddie fell forward, his head striking the wall.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      “Module engines active,” Lieutenant Ferraro called. “Course changing.”
    </p>

    <p>Lake turned. “Do they have time?”</p>

    <p>Straker studied the readings.</p>

    <p>He shook his head.</p>

    <p>----</p>

    <p>The module roared.</p>

    <p>
      We’re not going to make it, Nakamura thought — but he said nothing. Hale
      had to know and there was no point frightening the child.
    </p>

    <p>The Moon surged up to meet them. Moonbase slid out of view.</p>

    <p>At least they wouldn’t take Moonbase with them.</p>

    <p>Freddie turned, holding his bleeding head, and looked out.</p>

    <p>The Moon.</p>

    <p>He’d made it.</p>
