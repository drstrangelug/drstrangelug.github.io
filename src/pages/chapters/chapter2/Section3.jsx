      “I don’t like boats,” said Paul, paddling from the rear seat. “And I’m
      getting damp.”
    </p>

    <p>“It’s the sea,” Sarah said. “You're going to get wet.”</p>

    <p>They continued paddling. After a moment she pointed.</p>

    <p>“There it is. The naval base.”</p>

    <p>“It’s Royal Navy. We shouldn’t be here.”</p>

    <p>
      “It’s not Royal Navy. They shut it down years ago.” She kept her paddle
      moving. “I don’t know who’s using it now, but it’s not the Navy.”
    </p>

    <p>“We should go back. We could get caught.”</p>

    <p>“After all this, do you really want to go back?”</p>

    <p>
      Paul shook his head. “No. I don’t want to go back.” He rested his paddling
      for a second. “I’d like to find out what’s in there.”
    </p>

    <p>He hesitated.</p>

    <p>“I’m not sure why,” Paul said.</p>

    <p>
      Sarah didn’t answer. She dipped her paddle again, quicker this time. Paul
      followed.
    </p>

    <p>Something moved near the dock. Dark. Low.</p>

    <p>“Look!” Sarah hissed.</p>

    <p>Paul leaned forward. “What is that?”</p>

    <p>“A ship.”</p>

    <p>“Like… an aircraft carrier?”</p>

    <p>
      “No.” She shook her head. “Too small. Aircraft carriers don’t look like
      that.”
    </p>

    <p>They stopped paddling without meaning to.</p>

    <p>
      “That’s a plane,” Paul said. “On the front. That’s definitely a plane.”
    </p>

    <p>“Planes don’t go there,” Sarah said. “That’s part of the boat.”</p>

    <p>
      “It’s definitely a plane. I’ve built loads of Airfix ones,” Paul added
      quickly. “Never seen one like that, though.”
    </p>

    <p>They watched the shape move across the water.</p>

    <p>
      “Definitely military,” Paul said. “I’m sure those are weapons on the
      front.”
    </p>

    <p>Bubbles appeared along the hull. The ship began to sink.</p>

    <p>“It’s sinking,” Paul said, surprised.</p>

    <p>“It’s submerging,” Sarah snapped. “It’s a submarine.”</p>

    <p>
      “That’s a periscope,” Paul said, pointing as it cut across the surface.
      “It’s turning — it’s looking at us!”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Quick — paddle!” Sarah grabbed her paddle and started turning the canoe
      around. “Let’s get out of here before we’re caught.”
    </p>

    <p>
      A light slashed out into the dusk, and the sound of a motorboat pierced
      the quiet.
    </p>

    <p>“Oh crap,” Paul said.</p>
