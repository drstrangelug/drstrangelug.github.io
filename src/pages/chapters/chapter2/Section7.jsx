    <p>
      The following morning, Colonels Foster and Lake met early at SHADO
      headquarters. Both had coffee. Neither seemed especially invested in it.
      The two reports lay open between them.
    </p>

    <p>“Could just be a coincidence,” Foster said eventually.</p>

    <p>“Could be,” Lake replied. “Maybe.”</p>

    <p>Foster didn’t look up.</p>

    <p>
      “It’s not, though, is it?” he said. “You can feel it as well, can’t you?”
    </p>

    <p>Lake took a moment before answering.</p>

    <p>“Yes.”</p>

    <p>Silence returned. Foster picked up Lake’s report and read it again.</p>

    <p>
      “Ordinary kids,” he said. “Sarah and Paul. Sarah’s bright. Top grades,
      mostly.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Same with Jonathan,” Lake said. She was rereading Foster’s report now.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Football. Films. Family,” Foster continued. “No behavioural flags. No
      trouble at school.”
    </p>

    <p>
      He set his coffee down and rubbed his eyes. He hadn’t made it back to the
      studio until close to midnight.
    </p>

    <p>“Are we trying to see a pattern that isn’t there?”</p>

    <p>Lake didn’t answer immediately.</p>

    <p>“I don’t know,” she said at last.</p>

    <p>
      “One more pass,” Foster suggested. “If we still come up empty, we file
      it.”
    </p>

    <p>“All right.”</p>

    <p>
      Foster stood and pinned both reports to the cork board. Side by side, they
      didn’t look like much.
    </p>

    <p>
      “So lets ask ourselves again. What are we actually looking at?” he asked.
    </p>

    <p>Lake considered the board.</p>

    <p>
      “Three children,” she said. “Curious. Bright enough to notice things.
      Oddly calm when they shouldn’t be.”
    </p>

    <p>“Right.”</p>

    <p>
      “Nothing aggressive. No sabotage. No obvious motive,” she went on. “And no
      links between them.”
    </p>

    <p>Foster nodded.</p>

    <p>“Apart from age.”</p>

    <p>Lake frowned.</p>

    <p>“Apart from age,” she agreed.</p>

    <p>She scanned the notes again, more out of irritation than hope.</p>

    <p>
      “Ordinary lives,” she said quietly. “Football. Television. Computer club.
      Music. Chess club.”
    </p>

    <p>Foster stopped.</p>

    <p>“Computer club,” he repeated. “Sarah owns one, doesn’t she?”</p>

    <p>Lake checked.</p>

    <p>“Yes. A Sterling Prism.”</p>

    <p>Foster nodded once.</p>

    <p>“Jonathan has one too,” he said.</p>

    <p>Lake looked up.</p>

    <p>“A Sterlin Prism?”</p>

    <p>“Same model,” Foster confirmed.</p>

    <p>Lake exhaled slowly.</p>

    <p>“A lot of children have them. But it's a connection.” said Foster</p>

    <p>“It’s thin,” she said.</p>

    <p>“Almost nothing,” Foster agreed. “But it’s not nothing.”</p>

    <p>"We need to check them out, visit them".</p>

    <p>"It's an office, they're probably not open on Saturdays."</p>

    <p>Lake tapped her finger on her coffee cup.</p>

    <p>
      "We'll have to ring first thing Monday. How do we get in ? What's our
      cover?"
    </p>

    <p>Foster thought a second.</p>

    <p>
      "Well we're a studio remember - we want to some contemporary set
      decoration for a film. They'll bite our hand off for some free
      advertising."
