      “Engine control negative!” Nakamura yelled as the warning light flared.
    </p>

    <p>Hale looked up from the checklist. "What?!"</p>

    <p>“Primary and secondary engine control — offline.”</p>

    <p>Hale’s eyes flicked to the trajectory.</p>

    <p>“Then we’re committed,” he said quietly. “Moonbase, fast and close.”</p>

    <p>Nakamura didn’t answer. He was already running the numbers.</p>

      "De-orbit burn complete,” Lieutenant Ferraro reported. “Moonbase touchdown
      in—”
    </p>

    <p>He froze.</p>

    <p>“Engine control failure!”</p>

    <p>“They won’t be able to retro-fire,” Lake said.</p>

    <p>“They’ll hit Moonbase,” Straker replied. "Raise them now."</p>

    <p>Ferraro was already working the console.</p>

    <p>“Colonel Ellis on the line, sir.”</p>

    <p>
      “Colonel,” Straker said, voice flat, “red alert. Flight Three Alpha is
      uncontrolled. Impact in under twenty minutes.”
    </p>

    <p>Ellis absorbed that.</p>

    <p>
      “Understood, Commander. Lockdown procedures in progress. Missile batteries
      standing by. Interceptors launching.”
    </p>

    <p>Lake looked at Straker.</p>

    <p>“You’re ordering them shot down.”</p>

    <p>“It's procedure and you know it.” Straker said.</p>

    <p>“The wreckage—”</p>

    <p>“—will still be preferable.”</p>

    <p>Kelly stepped forward.</p>

    <p>“There may be another option.”</p>

    <p>Straker turned his head, just enough.</p>

    <p>“You'll have to be quick.”</p>

    <p>Kelly pointed to the approach vector.</p>

    <p>"We detonate interceptor warheads here—”</p>

    <p>He touched the screen.</p>

    <p>
      “—between the module and where we think the signal is coming from. Then
      radiation and electromagnetic noise might overwhelm the signal long enough
      to restore control. If the kid snaps out of he might scream for help and
      alert the crew.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Might block the signal, might snap the kid out of it.” Straker repeated.
    </p>

    <p>
      “We don’t know the signal strength,” Kelly said. “We don’t know the
      frequency or even if it’s electromagnetic.”
    </p>

    <p>Straker didn’t hesitate.</p>

    <p>
      “Colonel Ellis — have two interceptors fire at those coordinates.
      Staggered detonation. Hold one in reserve for the module.”
    </p>

    <p>“Yes sir,” Colonel Ellis replied “If this fails we'll take the shot.”</p>
