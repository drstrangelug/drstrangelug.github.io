      The sun was touching the horizon, its light turning orange, when Foster
      rejoined Whitcombe. A young aircraftwoman had brought in a tray with a
      teapot, some cups, and a plate of biscuits.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Terrible business,” Whitcombe said, picking up the teapot. “Shall I be
      mother?”
    </p>

    <p>Foster nodded. “In my line of work, we get a lot of unpleasant jobs.”</p>

    <p>
      Whitcombe said nothing to that. He knew better than to ask what line of
      work that was — he wouldn’t get an answer, and the question itself might
      be noticed. Who were these people, really?
    </p>

    <p>Instead, Whitcombe steered the conversation back to the children.</p>

    <p>
      “We’ve got them all secured in an unused hangar. Medics are tending to
      them. A good many bruises - thankfully only a few broken bones.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “No really serious injuries?” Foster asked, allowing a little relief to
      seep through.
    </p>

    <p>
      “None,” Whitcombe replied. “All easily recovered from — except one poor
      lad who might not make his dream of being a cricketer.” He shook his head
      faintly. “Shame, really. Our local team could do with some fresh talent.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Foster took the offered cup and a biscuit. He noted they came from one of
      the higher-end supermarkets.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I must commend you on your men,” he said. “No hesitation. When it needed
      to be done, they did it. You should be proud.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Whitcombe didn’t reply immediately — he simply nodded. Then he asked the
      question he’d been hoping he might get an answer to.
    </p>

    <p>“What caused that? They looked like they were possessed.”</p>

    <p>Foster didn’t hesitate. He had a cover story read to go.</p>

    <p>
      “Chemical contamination,” he said. “An industrial spill — antidepressant
      manufacturer. It got into a dairy farm before anyone realised.”
    </p>

    <p>He looked at the milk jug on the tray, then took a sip of tea.</p>

    <p>
      “Most of the milk was intercepted,” he went on. “But a batch of half-pints
      had already been distributed to a local school. Missed in the alert,
      clerical oversight..”
    </p>

    <p>Whitcombe looked at him, as if he was unsure of the explanation.</p>

    <p>
      “Chemical contamination,” Foster said. “Antidepressants. In the wrong
      doses.”
    </p>

    <p>He looked Whitcombe squarely in the eye.</p>

    <p>
      “They don’t make you violent. They make you certain. Certain enough to do
      something stupid and not stop.”
    </p>

    <p>He glanced back toward the hangar.</p>

    <p>“Children don’t have much resistance to that.”</p>

    <p>Whitcombe nodded once.</p>

    <p>“That would do it,” he said.</p>

    <p>
      He took a moment over his tea, eyes drifting briefly toward the hangar,
      then added, more quietly,
    </p>

    <p>
      “Glad it wasn’t something worse. Are you returning tonight, or do you have
      digs nearby?”
    </p>

    <p>Foster considered this.</p>

    <p>
      “I should do a once-over of our facilities to double-check,” he said. “By
      the time I'm done the traffic will be quiet, and I’ll be able to get home
      before it’s too late.”
    </p>

    <p>
      At that moment, the door opened and the sergeant came in quickly. He
      stopped in front of Whitcombe, pausing only long enough to salute before
      speaking hurriedly.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Sir! There’s been another breach.” He glanced at Foster. “Near their
      hangar.”
