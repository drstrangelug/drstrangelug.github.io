    <p>“Lunar Module to SHADO Control.”</p>

    <p>Nakamura waited for a response.</p>

    <p>“Lunar Module to SHADO Control.”</p>

    <p>He turned to Hale.</p>

    <p>“Another glitch?” Hale asked.</p>

    <p>Nakamura reached over and flicked the radio to the backup circuit.</p>

    <p>“Lunar Module to SHADO Control.”</p>

    <p>No reply.</p>

    <p>“Now I’m worried,” Hale said.</p>

    <p>Nakamura tapped at the module’s computer panel.</p>

    <p>“Running core systems diagnostics.”</p>

    <p>They waited. After a moment, the computer beeped.</p>

    <p>
      “Communications systems non-functional,” Nakamura read. “All other systems
      green.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “That’s not good at all,” Hale said. “But since the telemetry
      transmitter’s still green, then Control knows we’re still here — that
      comms are down, but everything else is nominal.”
    </p>

    <p>Nakamura glanced at the mission timer.</p>

    <p>
      “Do we turn around?” he asked. “It would take longer than continuing to
      Moonbase.”
    </p>

    <p>
      More time sealed in a spacesuit. More time before a proper meal. But they
      were professionals — and that didn’t really enter into it.
    </p>

    <p>Nakamura checked the timer.</p>

    <p>“We carry on,” he said. “Any further anomalies, we turn back.”</p>

    <p>Hale nodded. “Agreed.”</p>
