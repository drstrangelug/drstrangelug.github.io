      Sarah Collins looked at the workbench. Parts of the computer — a device
      she had designed and helped bring into the world — were scattered across
      it. Wires snaked between components, clipped to various chips. If she
      hadn’t known the machine’s internals so well, she might have been
      surprised it still functioned at all.
    </p>

    <p>She turned to Dr Kelly.</p>

    <p>“Well, you’ve certainly voided your warranty.”</p>

    <p>Kelly allowed himself a thin smile.</p>

    <p>
      She turned back and pointed to a thin cable clipped near the speaker
      grille.
    </p>

    <p>“That’s it, where you found the signal?” she said.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” Kelly replied. “That’s the one.”</p>

    <p>
      “And you can block it with lead.” She hummed softly, clicking her tongue
      as she thought.
    </p>

    <p>Colonel Lake stood nearby, watching without interrupting.</p>

    <p>Collins reached toward a small sheet of lead resting on the bench.</p>

    <p>“May I?”</p>

    <p>“Be my guest,” Kelly said.</p>

    <p>
      Collins lifted the sheet and held it over the unit. On the oscilloscope,
      the signal collapsed — then returned as she moved the lead away.
    </p>

    <p>
      She repeated the motion, slowly and deliberately, watching the trace with
      care. She adjusted the angle, then adjusted it again.
    </p>

    <p>“All right,” she said at last. “Here’s my idea.”</p>

    <p>She held the sheet up.</p>

    <p>
      “Cut a narrow slit in this. Mount it on a simple swing arm — glue a
      protractor to it to measure the angle. Put the unit underneath. Sweep the
      angle, record the angle where the signal comes back. Then rotate ninety
      degrees and repeat.”
    </p>

    <p>Kelly stared at her stunned.</p>

    <p>“Why didn’t I think of that?”</p>

    <p>Half an hour (and one broken protractor) later they had their result.</p>

    <p>Collins looked at the figures, then up at the ceiling.</p>

    <p>“That’s coming from space.”</p>

    <p>Lake folded her arms.</p>

    <p>
      “Aliens,” she said flatly. “And that gives us a bearing, not a location.”
    </p>

    <p>This time Kelly spoke.</p>

    <p>
      “That’s solvable,” he said. “With your permission, Colonel, I’ll get onto
      our research station in Canada. They can pick up a Prism locally from one
      of the local shops.”
    </p>

    <p>He tapped the oscilloscope.</p>

    <p>
      “A second bearing from there and we’ll have a workable fix on the source.”
    </p>

    <p>“Do it,” Lake said. “And do it fast.”</p>
