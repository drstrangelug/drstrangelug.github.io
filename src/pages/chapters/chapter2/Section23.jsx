    <p>Fred bumped into the floor as the module turned.</p>

    <p>He nearly felt sick, but managed to hold it in.</p>

    <p>He was an astronaut now, after all.</p>

    <p>The turning stopped and he felt better.</p>

    <p>His excitement built.</p>

    <p>The Moon! How close?</p>

    <p>Suddenly a roar filled the cargo bay and the whole ship shook.</p>

    <p>
      The boxes rattled and Fred fell forward. He had to throw his hands out to
      stop his head hitting the wall.
    </p>

    <p>He was doing a handstand in space.</p>

    <p>Then it got hard. His arms started to ache.</p>

    <p>This was like PE.</p>

    <p>He gritted his teeth. Astronauts didn’t give up.</p>

    <p>The shaking stopped. The noise died away.</p>

    <p>He floated again, relief washing over him.</p>

    <p>Phew.</p>

    <p>He looked at another panel.</p>

    <p>Why?</p>

    <p>That was engine control, he realised.</p>

    <p>If he disconnected that, they couldn’t take him home.</p>

    <p>
      Quickly, he undid the little winged screws — keeping hold of them this
      time.
    </p>

    <p>The engine control plug was stiff and wouldn’t come free.</p>

    <p>Then he realised it unscrewed.</p>

    <p>The cable, with its bulky dark red plug, floated gently away.</p>

    <p>Fred carefully put the panel back into place.</p>
