      “Still no contact, sir,” Harper said after another attempt. “Two minutes
      until scheduled descent burn.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Straker watched the track, the module creeping toward its marked course
      change.
    </p>

    <p>
      Something else bothered him — smaller, but no less real. He looked down at
      Harper.
    </p>

    <p>“Lieutenant,” he said. “When did your shift end?”</p>

    <p>She blinked. “Three hours ago, sir.”</p>

    <p>“Why are you still here?”</p>

    <p>“It’s an emergency, sir,” she said, suddenly uncertain.</p>

    <p>Straker nodded once.</p>

    <p>“Go and eat. Get some sleep.”</p>

    <p>She hesitated.</p>

    <p>“You don’t have the rank to be sleep-deprived” he added.</p>

    <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

    <p>
      Harper removed her headset and stepped away. Her relief took the seat
      without a word. Straker took her quietly aside and spoke softly.
    </p>

    <p>“Lieutenant — there will always be an emergency.”</p>

    <p>She straightened.</p>

    <p>
      “One day,” he said, “you'll be in a position where sleep and food will
      have to wait. Today isn’t that day.”
    </p>

    <p>“Yes, sir,” she said. “Understood.”</p>

    <p>As she left, Lake and Kelly came in, shortly followed by Collins.</p>

    <p>
      Collins had no idea whether she should be in here, but nobody had said
      anything.
    </p>

    <p>
      “We have coordinates,” Lake said, moving over to the secondary display
      board. “Tell SID to scan two-seven-nine by zero-five-one.”
    </p>

    <p>“Sending,” said the young lieutenant.</p>

    <p>
      “That’s way beyond the red line,” Straker said, referring to the limits of
      their scanner range.
    </p>

    <p>“It’s all we’ve got,” Lake replied. “We have to try it.”</p>

    <p>Straker said nothing.</p>

    <p>
      A moment later, the calm, mechanical tone of SID spoke through the speaker
      grille.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Attention. Scan complete for target area two-seven-nine by five-five-one.
      UFO contact: negative. Signal detection: negative.”
