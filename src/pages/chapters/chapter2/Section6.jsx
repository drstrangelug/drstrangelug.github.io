      The car handled the rougher Welsh roads well, absorbing the bumps and the
      worst of the badly repaired tarmac.
    </p>

    <p>“What did you make of the breach site, Agent Briggs?”</p>

    <p>
      “Not much, sir. Cloth scraps on the barbed wire. Remnants of footprints.
      As the kid said, he just went over for a look. No damage or nothing. Good
      feller on guard, makes a nice cocoa.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Did you ever climb into places you weren’t supposed to when you were a
      child?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Me, sir? No — unless there were an apple orchard on the other side. Not
      many of those guarded with barbed wire.”
    </p>

    <p>“Seems a bit extreme for a case of adolescent curiosity.”</p>

    <p>
      “Well,” Briggs said, shrugging, “as my mum would say — kids these days…”
    </p>

    <p>
      They continued without talking as they entered the town, only the radio
      softly playing. Turning into a council estate they soon found the house,
      with Briggs checking the map.
    </p>

    <p>Parking, just before they get out, Foster turned to Briggs.</p>

    <p>
      "Look and observe, light and friendly. Unless you find an alien under the
      bed."
    </p>

    <p>"Yes sir. You don't need to tell me twice."</p>

    <p>They both got out of the car and Foster knocked at the front door.</p>

    <p>A slightly rotund man answered.</p>

    <p>“Yes?”</p>

    <p>
      “Hello. Are you Mr Miller? I’m Paul Foster, and this is my colleague,
      Jason Briggs. We’re here from the Ministry of Defence.”
    </p>

    <p>The man’s shoulders tightened.</p>

    <p>
      “Is this about Jonathan? Come in before the neighbours see — he’s caused
      enough trouble already.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Inside, the unmistakable smell of a chip-shop fish tea hung in the air.
      The rest of the family sat at the dining table, the television murmuring
      behind them.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Look, he’s already been talked to by the police and some blokes from the
      Air Force,” Mr Miller said. “He’s grounded. I thought it was settled.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “It is,” Foster said mildly. “This is just a formality. We need to have a
      word with him, and check the premises.”
    </p>

    <p>“Why do you need to look around? He didn’t steal anything.”</p>

    <p>“Protocol,” Foster said. “May I speak with Jonathan?”</p>

    <p>The man hesitated, then sighed.</p>

    <p>“I suppose so. Mary — can you take them into the kitchen?”</p>

    <p>
      His wife rose and led Foster and the boy away. As they passed, Foster
      noticed the bandages still wrapped around Jonathan’s hands.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Jason,” Foster said, already looking elsewhere, “quick check around,
      please.”
    </p>

    <p>“Sure thing, Mr Foster.”</p>

    <p>
      As Foster and the others disappeared into the kitchen, Briggs remained
      behind, moving slowly through the living room. He checked the sideboard,
      the shelves, the corners people forgot about.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Look,” Mr Miller said quietly, following him with his eyes. “He’s a good
      lad. Just did something stupid — like we all did at that age. Do we really
      need to do this? The police said he wouldn't be charged.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Briggs stopped. He turned, then leaned in slightly, lowering his voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Don’t tell anyone I said this,” he murmured, “but that base has links to
      an American agency.”
    </p>

    <p>He glanced around, conspiratorial.</p>

    <p>“You mean the CIA?”</p>

    <p>“Shh,” Briggs said. “Keep it down.”</p>

    <p>“Sorry.”</p>

    <p>Briggs nodded, reassured, then went on more quietly.</p>

    <p>
      “They’re jumpy. Having a young lad like him just climb in — it rattles
      them. We'll look around, do a bit of paperwork, and the yanks feel a bit
      better.”
    </p>

    <p>Mr Miller paused, considering this, and that he didn't have a choice.</p>

    <p>Briggs gestured toward the table.</p>

    <p>
      “That looks like a decent bit of fish there. If you let me and my boss
      have a quick look upstairs, we’ll be gone before it starts to get cold.”
    </p>

    <p>The man studied him for a moment, then nodded and sat down.</p>

    <p>
      Briggs left the room and climbed the stairs, noting the family photos
      lining the wall as he went.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upstairs was unremarkable. A bathroom. The main bedroom. Two smaller ones.
      He identified the boy’s room just as Foster reached the top of the stairs.
    </p>

    <p>“All good?” Foster asked.</p>

    <p>“So far, sir.”</p>

    <p>They stepped inside.</p>

    <p>
      “Football posters. Books. Homework,” Foster said quietly, taking it in. He
      nodded toward the desk. “Is that a computer?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yeah,” Briggs said. “My cousin got one of those for Christmas. He’s
      always messing about on it.”
    </p>

    <p>
      He leaned closer. The machine was plugged in, a game frozen, paused on the
      screen, waiting. Cassette tapes were stacked neatly beside it.
    </p>

    <p>“More games, I think,” Briggs said. “Some of them hand-labelled.”</p>

    <p>
      He picked up a magazine and flicked through it. “You type these programs
      in and record them to tape.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Foster moved slowly, scanning the room. He knelt and peered under the bed.
      Old clothes. A single adult magazines. Briggs suppressed a grin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Foster spotted something and reached further in before drawing the object
      out. A small plastic figure.
    </p>

    <p>A Mr Spock figure.</p>

    <p>Briggs looked at it for a moment.</p>

    <p>“Well, how about that,” he said flatly. “An alien under the bed.”</p>
