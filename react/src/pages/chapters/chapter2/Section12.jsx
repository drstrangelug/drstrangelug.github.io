      The group walked down the country lane, some holding hands, some singing.
      Children out for the day. Backpacks and sandwiches. Some carried
      footballs.
    </p>

    <p>There were over thirty of them — and not an adult among them.</p>

    <p>
      After an hour they came to a field. They smiled and spread out, started
      eating, sitting down, kicking the ball around. They ignored the wire fence
      at the border, as though it weren’t important enough to notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      A red SHADO lunar carrier, the module nested on its back, screamed its
      engines as it landed in the adjacent field.
    </p>

    <p>-----</p>

    <p>
      Doctors Kelly and Jackson stood opposite Straker’s desk. Foster and Lake
      remained a step back, silent witnesses.
    </p>

    <p>Straker didn’t bother with preamble.</p>

    <p>“So. What’s your report?”</p>

    <p>Kelly hesitated. Jackson answered first.</p>

    <p>
      “It isn’t a report yet, Commander. It would take days — weeks — to reach
      firm conclusions. We’d need direct access to the children. At present, all
      we have are theories.”
    </p>

    <p>Straker’s jaw tightened.</p>

    <p>“Then give me the best one.”</p>

    <p>Jackson inclined his head.</p>

    <p>“We don’t believe the children are being controlled.”</p>

    <p>Straker looked up sharply.</p>

    <p>
      “All previous incidents involving alien influence relied on implanted
      imperatives,” Jackson continued. “Not direct control. When the aliens
      interfered with Colonel Foster’s lunar module, they didn’t steer his
      actions. They implanted a single overriding need.”
    </p>

    <p>“To kill Commander Straker” Foster said quietly.</p>

    <p>
      “We remember,” Straker said. “So you’re saying this is the same
      mechanism?”
    </p>

    <p>“No,” Kelly said. “Or at least — not directly.”</p>

    <p>
      He stepped forward, indicating the signal graphs he'd placed on Straker's
      desk.
    </p>

    <p>
      “The signal we’re seeing is constant. Minimal variation. There simply
      isn’t enough complexity in it to carry commands. We still can’t detect it
      outright — but we can see its effect on the circuitry. It’s… passive.”
    </p>

    <p>Straker frowned.</p>

    <p>“So it’s the signal combined with the tapes?”</p>

    <p>He stopped himself.</p>

    <p>“No… wait.”</p>

    <p>He frowned once.</p>

    <p>
      “I’m asking the wrong questions. All right, I’ll hold my tongue. Tell me
      everything you know.”
    </p>

    <p>Kelly glanced at Jackson. Jackson nodded once.</p>

    <p>Kelly drew a breath.</p>

    <p>
      “Our working theory is that the signal interacts with the program tapes
      and gradually opens a receptive pathway in the child’s brain. It doesn’t
      issue instructions. It makes the mind ready — more suggestible, more able
      to receive an imperative when one is applied.”
    </p>

    <p>Jackson took over.</p>

    <p>
      “At that point, a separate signal — one we cannot detect — implants what
      we’ve been calling an imperative.”
    </p>

    <p>Straker leaned back slightly.</p>

    <p>“It turns the child into a receiver.”</p>

    <p>“Yes,” Jackson said. “But not a puppet.”</p>

    <p>Straker’s gaze flicked to the computer on the side table.</p>

    <p>“We’ve had these machines running on base. Are we exposed?”</p>

    <p>
      “We believe not,” Jackson said. “Doctor Kelly has had the greatest
      exposure. I’ve examined him extensively. I can’t offer certainty — but I’m
      confident.”
    </p>

    <p>“And why is that?”</p>

    <p>
      “Because Doctor Kelly is in his forties,” Jackson said evenly. “Like
      myself. We believe this only works on developing minds. Children. Their
      neural structures are malleable. An adult brain is too fixed.”
    </p>

    <p>Lake spoke for the first time.</p>

    <p>“Then why only three children?”</p>

    <p>
      “Again we don’t know,” Kelly said. “The imperative signal may be targeted.
      Or it may be broadcast — and only a small number were susceptible.”
    </p>

    <p>The phone rang.</p>

    <p>Straker picked it up mid-ring.</p>

    <p>“Straker.”</p>

    <p>He listened.</p>

    <p>“Say that again.”</p>

    <p>Silence stretched.</p>

    <p>“I see.”</p>

    <p>He replaced the handset slowly.</p>

    <p>“It’s no longer isolated,” he said.</p>

    <p>Lake straightened.</p>

    <p>
      “There’s a large group of children gathering outside RAF Boscombe Down.”
