    <p>Lake put the fine china cup and saucer back onto the table.</p>

    <p>
      “Well you’ve certainly made an impact in the British computing sector,”
      she said to Sterling. “I believe you have most of the market.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Well, it’s the Sterling way,” he replied. “The right product at the right
      price. Nobody ever went broke giving people what they want — like the
      calculator or the pocket radio.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Did you set out to empower an entire generation to become computer
      programmers?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Oh, dear no!” He laughed at that. “I wanted to nab the BBC computer
      literacy project. Get Sterling products into every school.”
    </p>

    <p>“I see. And yet the Prism became more widespread than the winner.”</p>

    <p>
      “Well, that’s down to price and the way it adapts to the home. With their
      system you need a monitor, a disk drive — it all adds up. How’s a bus
      driver supposed to afford that? With my system, you plug it into your own
      television set and use a tape recorder you probably already have.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “And I suppose it’s new and exciting, which is why young minds latch on to
      it.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “I suppose so.” Sterling thought for a moment before continuing, a little
      more humbly. “Honestly, I never expected that. But it’s good to know.
      Thousands of young minds learning, exploring, creating. Finding a talent
      they never had. And having fun.”
    </p>

    <p>“The games?”</p>

    <p>
      “Yes — the games. I hated them at first. Trivial things, aping those
      machines you see by the seaside these days. But creating them turned out
      to be a challenge — the kind those children can sink their teeth into. It
      may be games now, but in ten or twenty years’ time those children are
      going to put Britain on the world’s electronic map.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Nobody said anything for a moment, both imagining the future. Sterling
      broke the reverie first.
    </p>

    <p>
      “So, how can I help get my little devices on screen? How many do you
      need?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Oh, one or two for set dressing. Maybe an empty five or six, so it won’t
      matter if the studio lights melt the plastic.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Oh, mere two? Take five! I’ll give you a dozen cases and a bunch of tapes
      with some software and games. I’ll get someone from stock to bring it all
      around to your car. Fill your boots!”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Or, to be more precise, fill my car’s boot? Please leave me room for the
      spare tyre.”
    </p>

    <p>They both chuckled.</p>

    <p>----</p>

    <p>
      “All clear,” Harper said, putting the bug tracker away as the car reached
      the motorway.
    </p>

    <p>“Conclusions?” Lake asked.</p>

    <p>
      “Professional place,” Harper said. “Proud of what they’ve done. And not
      without reason.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Sterling seems straight,” Lake said. “Ambitious, but straight. He
      believes in what he’s built, and that it will give him his place in
      history. ”
    </p>

    <p>Harper framed her next sentence carefully.</p>

    <p>
      “When the computer loads the tape, there’s an additional sound,” Harper
      said. “Low level. Subtle. They didn’t appear to know it was there. It may
      be accidental.”
    </p>

    <p>Lake nodded once.</p>

    <p>
      “We’ll have the technical section take a look,” Lake said. "Tear one of
      these things apart and see how it ticks."
    </p>

    <p>Harper glanced back toward the rear of the car.</p>

    <p>“Did we leave them any stock?”</p>

    <p>Lake smiled.</p>

    <p>“We even got some mugs.”</p>
