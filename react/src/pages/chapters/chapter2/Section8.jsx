      Lake pulled up outside Sterling the HQ of Computers. An impressive modern
      steel-and-glass building, its name — Sterling Applied Sciences — displayed
      prominently. She noted that the font and colour matched the branding on
      their computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Okay, Miss Harper,” Lake said. “Ready for your first day as assistant to
      a studio bigwig?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yes, Ms Lake,” Harper replied, adjusting her tone as she slipped into
      cover.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Let me handle the talking,” Lake said. “I’ll send you off to look around
      — take notes, be chatty. Remember, the computer is just going to be a prop
      in a film scene.”
    </p>

      “And here is our design lab,” Malcolm Sterling announced, already moving
      again. “The next Prism model, the plus. The Sterling Nova, our business
      model. Peripherals, repair kits. We do a lot of our hands on design in
      here.”
    </p>

    <p>He didn’t wait to see if they were following. He assumed they were.</p>

    <p>
      Sterling had a way of occupying space without imposing himself on it. He
      was not tall, nor especially imposing, but he moved with an easy
      certainty, as if the building were an extension of his own thinking. He
      touched things as he spoke — a casing here, a workbench there — not to
      demonstrate ownership, but familiarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      “And this,” he went on, brightening slightly as he stopped by a cluttered
      bench, “this is what I’m rather excited about.”
    </p>

    <p>He picked up a small unit and turned it in his hands.</p>

    <p>
      “Storage. Like a floppy drive, but affordable. Mass market affordable.”
    </p>

    <p>
      He spoke quickly, but not carelessly. His words had the rhythm of someone
      used to explaining ideas — and used to being listened to. Whenever he
      spoke about the company, a note of pride crept in, unguarded and
      unmistakable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lake hadn’t expected a personal tour, but she wasn’t surprised. Her
      research over the weekend had made it clear that Sterling did not hide
      behind his organisation. He was part of the product — visibly,
      unapologetically so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sterling, still holding the unit, glances back at Lake as if she'd
      suddenly remembered her.
    </p>

    <p>“So — what’s the film?”</p>

    <p>Lake doesn’t miss a beat.</p>

    <p>
      “A few separate ones actually. Contemporary. Near-future. Offices, homes —
      that sort of thing. One of our set dressers suggested a home computer
      would help sell it. Film and TV”
    </p>

    <p>
      "I don't watch a lot of television myself. A good film now and again.
      Gandhi was good."
    </p>

    <p>Sterling put the device down and rubbed his hands together.</p>

    <p>
      “I usually stop for tea about now,” Sterling said. “Would you like some
      Darjeeling while we go over what you need?”
    </p>
