      It was early morning, and as was normal Lieutenant Diane Harper was
      reviewing the filed security reports. The duty rotated day to day and was
      usually little more than a skim — the computers flagged anything serious
      or anomalous. Her job was simply to give the reports a human pass, in case
      something slipped through.
    </p>

    <p>Then she paused.</p>

    <p>An intrusion. Juvenile involvement.</p>

    <p>That sounded familiar.</p>

    <p>
      Harper frowned and scrolled back through the previous week’s entries. Had
      the report been refiled by mistake? It happened often enough — amended
      information, late corrections. But in those cases the update date changed,
      not the incident date.
    </p>

    <p>She pulled the earlier file.</p>

    <p>No. This was different.</p>

    <p>
      That incident had been a single boy, in Wales. This one involved a boy and
      a girl, in Norfolk — the Weybourne Skydiver pen.
