    <p>Lieutenant Harper knocked at the door.</p>

    <p>“Come in,” called Colonel Lake’s voice.</p>

    <p>Diane stepped in.</p>

    <p>“Good morning, Colonel.”</p>

    <p>“Good morning, Lieutenant. How can I help you?”</p>

    <p>
      “An odd coincidence. I thought one of the reports had been duplicated by
      mistake. It turns out it’s a separate incident, but with some notable
      similarities.”
    </p>

    <p>“Let me have a look.”</p>

    <p>Harper waited while Lake read the reports, quickly, before speaking.</p>

    <p>
      “Minor incidents,” Lake said. “In both senses of the word. But an odd
      coincidence.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “In the training manual it says we’re not allowed to believe in
      coincidences.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “True,” Lake said, “but when you get to my rank you’ll realise the
      training manual is more nuance than pure strictures.”
    </p>

    <p>Lake paused, thinking.</p>

    <p>
      “No — you’re right. We should check it out. How do you fancy a day by the
      seaside?”
    </p>

    <p>“Me, sir?” Harper was surprised. “I’m rostered here all day.”</p>

    <p>
      “I’ll assign cover. Come on — you found it, you fix it. Colonel Foster is
      near the Wales site; I’ll see if he can check that out.”
