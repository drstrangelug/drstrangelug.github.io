      “Hey — that’s odd,” Nakamura said, pointing a gloved hand at the small
      gauge. “CO₂ scrubbers are reading a higher intake than usual.”
    </p>

    <p>Hale leaned closer.</p>

    <p>“You’re right. Just slightly.”</p>

    <p>Nakamura glanced over at him.</p>

    <p>“You’re not sneaking a cigarette break in here, are you?”</p>

    <p>Hale shook his head.</p>

    <p>“I gave up. Same as you. I don’t pay people to poison me.”</p>

    <p>Nakamura watched the needle for a moment.</p>

    <p>
      “Could be nothing. Let’s see if it normalises,” he said. “If not, we’ll
      log it at the next check-in. Let maintenance worry about it once we’re
      down.”
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>Things had settled down. It was quiet.</p>

    <p>Fred was still grinning from ear to ear.</p>

    <p>Space.</p>

    <p>They couldn’t stop him now. He’d done it.</p>

    <p>Oh.</p>

    <p>Unless they turned back.</p>

    <p>He hadn’t thought of that until now.</p>

    <p>
      He’d got in round the back while the other children had been climbing over
      the front. But they could have found that by now. He could be caught. They
      could tell them to turn back.
    </p>

    <p>Could spaceships turn back?</p>

    <p>
      He couldn’t see why not. His dad was always threatening to turn the car
      around and go home if Fred didn’t behave.
    </p>

    <p>He looked at the wall. There were some metal screws with handles.</p>

    <p>The radio was behind there.</p>

    <p>He didn’t question how he knew.</p>

    <p>
      He undid the screws. The first one floated away. He made sure to keep hold
      of the other three.
    </p>

    <p>
      Carefully, he pulled the panel away, reached in, and slid the cable off
      the radio circuit board.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, just as carefully, he put the panel back and screwed in the three
      remaining screws.
    </p>

    <p>He caught the floating one and decided to pocket it as a souvenir.</p>

    <p>A space screw!</p>
