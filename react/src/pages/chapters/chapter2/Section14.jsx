      “It’s dashed odd, but they’re just children,” said Squadron Leader
      Whitcombe. “And there’s a fence. What are they going to do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Whitcombe was tall and thin, with a chevron moustache neatly combed. His
      uniform was exceptionally clean, precisely pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Squadron Leader,” Foster said, “we have reason to suspect there’s more
      going on than meets the eye. We need to be careful. They may attempt to
      breach the fence.”
    </p>
    <p>The Squadron Leader scoffed.</p>
    <p>
      “I think we can keep a school at bay,” he said. “Unless you’re not telling
      me something important.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked out of the window toward the fence, raising his binoculars. It
      looked as though there were nearly a hundred children now — possibly more.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I never know what those planes of yours are doing,” he added, “aside from
      launching moon ships.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A small girl turned and for a second it looked like she had noticed
      Whitcombe. He pulled back from the binoculars in slight surprise, then
      raised them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl walked calmly toward the fence, and then without hesitating she
      began to climb it. Two boys followed, joining her to her side and slightly
      behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dash it all!” Whitcombe exclaimed, lowering the binoculars and turning
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sergeant — get some security bods out there now. Secure the fence. Stop
      them before anyone gets hurt.”
    </p>
    <p>“Sir!” snapped the sergeant, saluting before rushing out.</p>
    <p>
      Foster had just enough time to see the remaining mass of children turn -
      not all at once, but together - before he followed.
    </p>
    -----
    <p>
      They were quiet. No shouts, no noises of children at play. That was the
      first thing that struck Foster as he crossed inside the fence. They
      climbed without speaking, entirely preoccupied, an unerring focus in their
      eyes. He hadn’t spent much time around children, but this didn’t seem
      right.
    </p>
    <p>Base security personnel were already there.</p>
    <p>“Get down!” some shouted.</p>
    <p>“This is a restricted area!”</p>
    <p>
      A few guards tried to lift them down and were shocked when the children
      struck out. There were yells — and two bloody noses on the RAF side — but
      nothing more. The first children were already over the fence, dropping to
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      An alarm began to sound — a clear, ringing bell — as the children started
      running toward the nearest building.
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavyset officer swung his truncheon and smashed it into the nearest
      child’s leg. The child collapsed, screaming, clutching the impact site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foster felt an instinctive surge of anger — the urge to berate the
      officer, to get to the child.
    </p>
    <p>Then he realised - and felt his stomach drop.</p>
    <p>The child was crying. Holding his leg. Present.</p>
    <p>The control was broken.</p>
    <p>“Hurt them!” Foster shouted. “That’s the only way!”</p>
    <p>
      Part of him recoiled at the words even as he spoke them. But he knew it
      had to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around him, the guards began to comply. Cries and wails filled the air —
      the sound of children in pain — drowning out even the engines of the
      nearby jets.
