      “It’s a little snug in here,” Ford said as he examined the cramped office.
    </p>

    <p>“It’s only temporary.”</p>

    <p>Alec put his briefcase down.</p>

    <p>
      “We’ll be getting new digs at the IAC. I’m told only a week or two, so we
      should probably plan how we’re going to decorate in here for Christmas.”
    </p>

    <p>Ford sat down and noticed the chair rocked slightly, its legs uneven.</p>

    <p>
      “So let’s start,” Alec continued, settling into his worn leather executive
      chair. “What are we doing here?”
    </p>

    <p>“Planning an expanded Moonbase, unless the brief has changed.”</p>

    <p>
      “But let’s examine that. The purpose. What are we actually achieving?”
    </p>

    <p>Ford paused, considering how best to answer.</p>

    <p>
      “Capacity. Three Interceptors give us three UFO kills at best — and not
      always that. Four UFOs means at least one gets through.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “And we can’t just add more Interceptors from the reserve,” Alec said.
      “Moonbase is already at capacity. Fuel storage, accommodation, power. Even
      food and water. You add even one Interceptor and the effects start
      compounding.”
    </p>

    <p>“Compounding effects.”</p>

    <p>“Yes. So do we just build a second Moonbase? ‘Moonbase Two’?”</p>

    <p>
      Ford picked up a pen and began twirling it between his fingers — not
      something he usually did on duty, Alec noted.
    </p>

    <p>
      “We could. Pricey, but doable. Known systems, no major technical unknowns.
      It would save on design costs and give us redundancy.” He paused. “But it
      feels like the wrong answer.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “And Moonbase was designed ten years ago. We should be able to do better —
      more modern, more capable.”
    </p>

    <p>“That would take even longer, and cost even more.”</p>

    <p>“Cost. We’re trying to save the planet and it comes down to pennies.”</p>

    <p>
      Ford put the pen down, as if he’d just realised what he was doing. “We
      lifted all the components for Moonbase from Earth. A lot of heavy-lift
      capacity from NASA, if I recall the records correctly. That will eat a lot
      of the cost.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Well, to build a Moonbase we still have to take the parts to the Moon.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “What if we didn’t? Take the parts, I mean. What if we build it from local
      materials?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “In situ resource utilisation? That’s what the technicians call it, isn’t
      it?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yes. I know the Dalotek Corporation is itching to get back to the Moon.
      And Commander Straker is blocking it.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “He blamed them for the comms outage. Hated them being there. But credit
      to him — after the fact he admitted he was wrong. They were just in the
      wrong place at the wrong time.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “They want to go back. They have mineral samples and studies, and they
      want to try techniques for lunar manufacturing.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “How do you know this?” Alec asked, clearly impressed by the depth of
      knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I read technical publications for fun. They ran an article in a
      construction trade magazine last year. Iron and aluminium from the
      regolith — not just the oxygen Moonbase extracts.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Alec nodded. “That would help. And if they’re going to build up there,
      they’re going to need habitation, workshops, offices. We could probably do
      a deal.”
    </p>

    <p>
      "We'd be letting civilians back to the moon. Encouraging it even.
      Commander Straker won't like that."
    </p>

    <p>
      "You let me handle Straker." Alec stood up "Come on, I think we've earned
      a tea break."
    </p>

    <p>In the distance the sound of gunfire and explosions.</p>

    <p>"Ridly Scott again?" Alec asked.</p>

    <p>"No, another director, a new chap. He's filming a sequel to Alien."</p>

    <p>"Bad idea, sequels are never as good as the original."</p>
