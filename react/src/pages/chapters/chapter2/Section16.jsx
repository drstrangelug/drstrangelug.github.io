    <p>He was in space.</p>

    <p>Actually in space.</p>

    <p>
      Fred Calderton grinned, hardly daring to breathe in case it broke the
      feeling.
    </p>

    <p>
      It had been easy - just like he’d known it would be. The wire fence had
      come away in his hands and he’d slipped through before anyone noticed. His
      palms still stung a bit, but that didn’t matter. Not really.
    </p>

    <p>Because he was in space.</p>

    <p>
      Jim Harkins had gone on about Concorde for weeks after his family went to
      America. Supersonic this, Mach Two that.
    </p>

    <p>Well Fred had him beat for sure.</p>

    <p>He was going to the Moon.</p>

    <p>
      He pictured it already — floating, bouncing, like the astronauts on the
      telly. No gravity.
    </p>

    <p>Like a real astronaut.</p>

    <p>Fred’s grin widened.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Foster stared at the broken chain link fence.</p>

    <p>
      It had been forced open against a small concrete coal bunker. The gap
      between the fence and the wall was narrow — too narrow for any adult to
      squeeze through.
    </p>

    <p>But not for a child.</p>

    <p>The mass of children hadn't been the attack. They were the diversion,</p>

    <p>Foster sighed and realised they'd failed.</p>

    <p>He'd failed.</p>
