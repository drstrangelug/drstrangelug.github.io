      Lieutenant Morgan walked through the door, two steaming mismatched mugs in
      hand. He placed the dark red one in front of the boy sat at the table.
    </p>

    <p>
      “There you go lad,” Morgan said, in his deep Welsh accent, his voice all
      warm and friendly. “Hot cocoa. Just the thing on a cold foggy night like
      this.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The boy put his hands around the mug and warmed them. The grey painted
      brick room was cold, and the small electric heater on one wall felt like
      it was fighting a losing battle.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I’ve rung your Dad and he’ll be here shortly, although with this fog I
      hope he takes his time. Terrible road here when it’s icy.”
    </p>

    <p>He paused.</p>

    <p>
      “But you won’t be going home just yet. This is a secure facility and there
      will be questions. Forms. You’ve created a chunk of work for me and no
      mistake.”
    </p>

    <p>He looked at him, like a concerned uncle.</p>

    <p>“Why did you do it lad?”</p>

    <p>
      The boy looked down into his cocoa. He hesitated, then answered, his voice
      unsteady, catching as he spoke.
    </p>

    <p>“I was curious. I just… I just wanted to.”</p>

    <p>
      Morgan looked down at the boy’s hand, where he’d bandaged cuts from the
      barbed wire.
    </p>

    <p>
      “That must have hurt. Was it worth it to see a couple of sheds? Is my
      cocoa that famous for its flavour?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “No, it wasn’t worth it.” The boy took a sip of the cocoa. “But what do
      you actually do here?”
    </p>

    <p>“Paperwork,” replied Morgan. “Boring paperwork.”</p>

    <p>
      The boy gave a disappointed shrug and sipped again. “It really is nice
      cocoa.”
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      Dawn was trying to break through the heavy clouds. Cold rain, close to
      sleet, blew against Morgan’s face as he watched the car containing the boy
      and his father leave.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sliding the gate shut and locking it, Morgan remembered the long forms
      awaiting him.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Why do these things always happen when I’m on duty?” he asked aloud and
      alone.
