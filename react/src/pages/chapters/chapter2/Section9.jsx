      Harper put her tea down, resting the mug on its coaster. Both the coaster
      and the mug were white, bearing the logo of Sterling Applied Sciences.
    </p>

    <p>
      The young woman she sat next to was about her age and of a similar height,
      neatly dressed and professionally understated. She had dark red hair worn
      simply, and a paler complexion that made her look as though she spent more
      time indoors than she might like. She carried the calm assurance of
      someone who had always been expected to be capable, and the habit of
      paying attention when others spoke. She didn’t dominate the space — but
      she didn’t disappear into it either.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Can I ask something?” Harper said. “That noise when the tape’s loading —
      what actually is it? And why does the computer play it through the
      speaker? It sounds… quite harsh.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “It’s the data,” the young woman said. “Binary code, stored as sound
      waves. Initially, yes, it’s a bit jarring — but we found in early testing
      that users get used to it pretty quickly. Plus, the average loading time
      is up to four minutes, so you can read a book or something — and you can
      hear when it’s finished.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Users, not customers, Harper thought. A new language. New ways of
      thinking.
    </p>

    <p>“And you make the games as well as the computer here?” Harper asked.</p>

    <p>“Some of the games,” the woman replied.</p>

    <p>She lowered her voice a little.</p>

    <p>
      “Mr Sterling hated the idea of his creation being used for playing games.
      The ’79 and ’80 models — the black-and-white ones — didn’t ship with any
      games. But when he saw how a third-party market started to grow, and read
      stories in the papers about youngsters making enough money to buy a car
      before they could drive…”
    </p>

    <p>“How big is this third-party market?”</p>

    <p>
      “Oh, massive. We ship a couple of games with the Prism — helps sell it.
      But there are dozens, maybe a hundred or more companies solely making
      games.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Harper let that sit with her. A hundred. How many tapes were out there
      with programs on them instead of music?
    </p>

    <p>
      “So our little Prism is going to be a film star?” the young woman asked.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I hope so. Any computers you see on our sets right now are old ’50s or
      ’60s models with those massive tape reels.” Harper lowered her head and
      whispered, “Some are just cardboard boxes with tinfoil and lights on
      them.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “I hope that isn’t a trade secret,” the young woman said. “Because some of
      us have already noticed.”
    </p>

    <p>Harper giggled quietly, not entirely to maintain cover.</p>

    <p>
      “Please don’t tell Miss Lake,” she said. “At least we’re better than the
      BBC.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Harper picked up her cup and finished her tea. “Well, thank you for this.
      I should get back to Miss Lake before she misses me.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Harper placed the mug back down, and then noticed a small logo beneath the
      Sterling one: Northgate Holdings.
    </p>

    <p>“Who are they?” she asked, pointing to the mug.</p>

    <p>“Oh, investor group. The money men.”</p>

    <p>“I thought Sterling owned it all.”</p>

    <p>
      “Oh no — most of it, but not all. They’re quite good. Stay out of our
      hair. Give technical help — like getting that loading sound working
      without being too harsh.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Oh.” Harper paused for a second. “Is that why there’s that odd harmonic
      in the background, to smooth it out?”
    </p>

    <p>“Harmonic?” the woman asked, puzzled.</p>

    <p>
      “Yes. There’s a very slight background hum. Almost musical. Sort of tracks
      with the loading noise, but a little behind.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “There shouldn’t be. Are you sure?” She put her ear to the unit and
      listened.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Oh, I can hear it. I did violin lessons for years — I can have an ear for
      harmonies.”
    </p>

    <p>The woman pressed her ear to the machine’s case.</p>

    <p>
      “Wow. There it is.” She straightened, puzzled. She lifted her head and
      shrugged. “It’s a new mainboard revision. Maybe it needs a bit of
      filtering. Could even just be a bad solder joint.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “I'm sure you'll sort it out. I need to get back to Miss Lake. Thank you
      so much."
    </p>

    <p>"My pleasure."</p>

    <p>
      Harper left and the woman looked at the unit with a faint puzzled
      expression.
