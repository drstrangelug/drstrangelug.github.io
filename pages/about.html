  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my UFO 1999 website. This is a novelisation of a series that was never made - series two of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_(British_TV_series)">UFO by Gerry Anderson</a>.</p>

  <h2>Where to start</h2>
  <p>Right now if you just want to read then goto <a href="#" onclick="parent.loadPage('chapters')">chapters</a>.  I'd start with chapter 2 <b>Geeks</b> as honestly it's what I think is the best right now.  Chapter 1 was a warm up, chapter 2 really just flowed out of me.</p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>I first watched both UFO and Space: 1999 in the 1970s as a childen. In the 1980s and 1990s it was shown on various
    other channels and I discovered it again.</p>
  <p>Then one day I saw a friend's copy of a two documentaries detailing first how UFO was made and then how Space:1999
    was made. The interesting part was that at the end of the UFO documentary they talked about how the American PBS
    networks were getting good ratings and were keen on commissioning a second series. With production on UFO already
    wrapped up the Gerry Anderson team came up with UFO 1999, advancing the story twenty years. Then the ratings
    dropped, the series never happened and the concept work done for UFO 1999 was reused for Space: 1999</p>
  <p>The idea of continuing the series, not just jumping to 1999 but charting the between years, stuck in my head. And
    stayed there for 30 years.</p>
  <p>So come 2026, the idea pops up again, as it did every now and again. But this time we have AI. Bored one night I go
    at it with AI and use it as a sounding board, and eventually I have a series out line for 2 seasons. Then did a
    thread where I imagined who I'd cast if this was made. Then I got sad because this was never going to happen.</p>
  <p>Then I thought 'screw that - I'll do it myself. Just for me'</p>
